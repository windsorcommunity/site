## What's a Slosh?

A slosh is a social gathering for the polyamory and ethical non-monogamy community, kind of like a munch is in the kink world. We get together, grab a few drinks, eat if we want to, and talk and get to know each other.

The slosh is a great place to meet other ethically non-monogamous folks in the area, to share ideas about future events, to give us feedback or suggestions, or just to have a fun night out with folks who get your relationship style.

We welcome those in or interested in polyamory and open relationships. Whether youâ€™re currently in an open or poly relationship, have prior experience, or are just curious about it, feel free to join us!

## House Rules

Slosh Rules

### Learn
Our events are geared towards learning about polyamory and developing new friendships and connections within the community. It is not a play space; therefore no nudity, kink, or sex play will be permitted at this event.

### Open Communication
Poly is all about open and honest communication! Help us create a space that facilitates trust, where people can come to give and receive support.

### Verbal Consent
Please be sure to ask before initiating any
physical contact and encourage each other to speak openly about consent and personal boundaries. This helps foster a culture where attendees feel empowered to speak confidently about their limits.

### Expectations
Check them at the door! Being at this event does not automatically mean someone is sexually available, nor does it indicate any aspect of sexual orientation.

### Respect
Treating everyone at this event with respect is a must, this includes wait staff. Anyone who is not following these rules may be politely asked to leave this event.

### Safe Space
Windsor Polyamory wants to create a safe space for people of ALL identities, including those who do not identify themselves as polyamorous. No photography, video, or recording of any kind is allowed without prior verbal consent of all parties involved.

Hope to see you there!
